Youtube and google is a very useful tool to explore new stuff!!


The worst part has been cooking two separate meals at lunch and dinner. I in no way expect my son and husband to join me in this, so I've been baking them breads and making them potatoes and rice, and all that sort of thing. It sucks having my hands in bread dough almost daily, and having to smell it cooking. :(
